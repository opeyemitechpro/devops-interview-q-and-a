## Que 1 - How is AWS? {#ci-cd-multi-cloud-deploy1}

??? success "Answer"

    This is a multi-stage process focusing on artifact management and environment-specific deployment scripts.
    
    1.  **Source & Build (in AWS):**
        *   **Trigger:** A `git push` to a repository (e.g., AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, Azure Repos) triggers an AWS CodePipeline pipeline.
        *   **Build Stage:** An AWS CodeBuild project pulls the source code, runs tests, and builds the application. Most importantly, it packages the application into a cloud-agnostic artifact, like a Docker container, and pushes it to a central registry like Amazon ECR or Docker Hub.
    
    2.  **Deployment (Multi-cloud):**
        *   **AWS Deployment Stage:** A CodeDeploy or CloudFormation step in the pipeline pulls the Docker image from ECR and deploys it to an AWS environment (e.g., ECS, EKS, or EC2).
        *   **Azure Deployment Stage:** This is the key part. We add another stage to CodePipeline that triggers an Azure-native deployment tool. This could be:
            *   **A Lambda/CodeBuild Step:** A step that runs the Azure CLI (`az`) or Terraform/Pulumi to deploy the container to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service. This step would need Azure credentials, securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
            *   **Webhook Trigger:** The pipeline could call a webhook that triggers an Azure DevOps Pipeline or a GitHub Action, which then handles the deployment to Azure.

    This design uses a central artifact registry as the "source of truth" for what gets deployed, ensuring consistency across clouds.
